Two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) program, which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of obligations outstanding that the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions under the SCF program was $1,421 million and $1,351 million, respectively.",

Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of both December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $1.7 billion of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements.",

The program is expected to be available to U.S. based suppliers starting in the second quarter of 2024. The Company makes continuous efforts to improve working capital efficiency and has worked with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions. The Company’s current payment terms with a majority of suppliers generally range from 0 to 180 days, which is deemed to be commercially reasonable. The Company’s voluntary SCF program will allow its suppliers to elect to sell the receivables owed to them by the Company to a third-party financial institution. The suppliers, at their own discretion, will determine the invoices they want to sell and directly negotiate the arrangements with the participating third-party financial institution. Supplier participation in the program is solely the decision of the supplier and has no bearing on the Company’s payment terms and amounts due with the supplier. The Company’s responsibility will be limited to making payments based upon the agreed upon contractual terms and arrangements. The Company will not provide any form of guarantees under the SCF program and will have no economic interest in the suppliers’ decision to participate in the SCF program. Amounts due to suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF program will be included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company, or the third-party financial institution, may choose to terminate the agreement of the program at any time upon 30 days’ prior written notice. The third-party financial institution may also terminate the agreement of the program at any time upon three business days’ prior written notice in the event there are insufficient funds available for disbursements. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no amounts outstanding related to suppliers’ participation in the SCF program.",

Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The payment terms under the program vary, but the program has a weighted average maturity date that is approximately 90 days from each respective financing inception. These financing arrangements are included in the current portion of borrowings within the consolidated balance sheets and at the time of issuance each transaction is treated as a non-cash financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. Upon settlement of the financing, the cash outflow is classified as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. Amounts outstanding under this program were $3.8 million, $13.5 million and $24.0 million at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including $1.1 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to purchases of property, plant and equipment. Cash outflows under this program were $41.9 million, $64.6 million and $63.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.We maintain a voluntary supply chain financing (""SCF"") program with a global financial institution which allows a select group of suppliers to sell their receivables to the participating financial institution at the discretion of both parties on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the financial institution. The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the program are paid by us to the financial institution according to the terms we have with the supplier. Amounts outstanding under the SCF program were $27.6 million and $29.8 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We also participate in a virtual card program with a global financial institution, in which we pay supplier invoices on the due date using a Virtual Card Account (""VCA"") and subsequently pay the balance in full 25 days after the billing statement date of the VCA. The program allows for suppliers to receive an accelerated payment for a fee at each supplier's discretion. Fees paid by our suppliers are negotiated directly with the financial institution without our involvement. Amounts outstanding under the VCA program were $7.6 million and $6.8 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.The payment terms we have with our suppliers who participate in the SCF and VCA programs are consistent with the typical terms we have with our suppliers who do not participate. These financing arrangements are included in accounts payable within the consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows.",

Under the program, suppliers have the option to be paid by the bank or intermediary earlier than the payment due date. When the supplier receives an early payment, they receive discounted amounts, and the Company pays the bank or intermediary the face amount of the invoice on the payment due date. The Company does not reimburse suppliers for any costs incurred for participation in the program. The Company and its suppliers agree on the contractual terms, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the supplier finance programs. The suppliers’ voluntary inclusion in the supplier financing programs has no bearing on the Company’s payment terms. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the programs, and the Company has no direct financial relationship with the banks or other intermediaries as it relates to the supplier finance programs. As of December 31, 2023, payment terms with the majority of the Company’s suppliers are generally 30 to 180 days, which correspond to the contractual terms, with rates that are based on market rates (such as SOFR) plus a credit spread. There are no assets pledged as security under the programs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amounts outstanding that remain unpaid to the banks or other intermediaries totaled $82.7 million and $121.5 million, respectively, and are reflected in “Accounts payable” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

Supplier Finance ProgramsThe Company has various supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions that are made available to suppliers to facilitate payment term negotiations. Under the terms of these agreements, participating suppliers receive payment in advance of the payment date from third-party financial institutions for qualifying invoices. Alcoa’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and payment terms, are not impacted by its suppliers’ participation in these programs. The Company does not pledge any assets as security or provide any guarantees beyond payment of outstanding invoices at maturity under these arrangements. The Company does not pay fees to the financial institutions under these arrangements. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, qualifying supplier invoices outstanding under these programs were $104 and $185, respectively, and have payment terms ranging from 50 to 110 days.

0000063276,MATTEL INC /DE/,1,"Supplier Finance ProgramMattel has an agreement with a third-party financial institution that allows certain participating suppliers the opportunity to voluntarily finance payment obligations of Mattel under a supplier finance program. Under this program, participating suppliers may accelerate the timing of collection of their receivables due from Mattel, prior to their scheduled due dates, by selling one or more of their receivables at a discounted price to the third-party financial institution. The range of payment terms Mattel negotiates with suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether the suppliers participate in the supplier finance program and Mattel does not have any economic interest in any suppliers' decision to participate in the supplier finance program. Suppliers participating in the program are able to select which individual Mattel invoices they sell to the third-party financial institution. However, all Mattel payments of the full amounts due to participating suppliers are paid on the invoice due date based on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the individual invoice due to the supplier is sold to the third-party financial institution. Included in Mattel's accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $54.3 million and $86.0 million of outstanding payment obligations due to suppliers, respectively, under the supplier finance program. All payment activities related to the supplier finance program were presented within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.",

The Company’s suppliers’ ability to access the program is primarily dependent upon the strength of the Company’s financial condition and certain qualifying criteria. The program allows these suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to the contractual payment date, subject to a payment of a discount. The capacity of the program is limited to $127.5 at any point in time. If a supplier’s request exceeds the program limit, then it will be honored when capacity is available. Under the supply chain financing program, the Company agrees to pay the third-party financing institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, and suppliers have the ability to be paid from the third-party financing institution on an accelerated basis. The Company’s suppliers’ election to sell one or more of the Company’s confirmed obligations under the supply chain financing program is optional. The Company’s responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with its suppliers for up to 120 days, regardless of whether the suppliers elect to sell their receivables to the third-party financing institution. Within the current population of qualified suppliers, there are no payment discounts offered or taken at any point by the financing institution or by the Company.  The Company or the third-party financing institution may terminate the agreement upon at least 45 days’ notice.The balance of confirmed obligations outstanding to suppliers who elect to participate in the supply chain financing program is included in the Company’s Accounts payable balance on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes in each period primarily reflect purchases from suppliers related to production levels during the respective periods and are summarized as follows:",

Additionally, a global financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance program (the “SCF Program”) which enables suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution on a non-recourse basis.The Company and its suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services procured, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF Program. Payments terms average approximately 126 days. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Suppliers that participate in the SCF Program, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institution. The suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF Program does not change the Company’s existing contractual terms with its suppliers. The Company does not provide any guarantees under the SCF Program, nor does it have any economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF Program as of December 31, 2023.",

Suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to finance confirmed invoices prior to their scheduled due date at a discounted price with the Company's third-party finance provider. Outstanding obligations related to the Program were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. These obligations were recorded within Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

0001060822,CARTERS INC,1,"SUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAMWe have established a voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) program through participating financial institutions. This SCF program enables participating suppliers to accelerate payments for receivables due from the Company by selling them directly to the participating financial institutions at their discretion. As of December 30, 2023, the SCF program has a $70.0 million revolving capacity. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the SCF program. Payment terms for most of our suppliers are 60 days, regardless of participation in the SCF program. The Company does not provide any guarantees under the SCF program.The Company’s liability related to amounts payable to the participating financial institution for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, amounts under the SCF program included in Accounts payable were $14.8 million and $16.5 million, respectively.

The agreement has a limit of $60.0 million in payment obligations ($85.0 million during peak season from August to January). There is no requirement to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees under the agreement.

The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2023, except for the roll-forward information, which is effective beginning on January 1, 2024. This guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  During 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third-party financial institution and an agreement with an insurance agency which allows us to obtain extended payment terms for our insurance policies. The insurance policies can be canceled by the Company at any time with 10 days’ notice. The financial institution may cancel this agreement after providing 10 days’ notice if the Company does not pay any installment payment according to the terms of the agreement. We do not provide any forms of guarantees under these agreements. Payments of our obligations are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Outstanding confirmed amounts are $0 and $218 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which will be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements as payments are due.",
